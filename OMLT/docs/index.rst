OMLT
========

OMLT is a Python package for representing machine learning models (neural networks and gradient-boosted trees) within the Pyomo optimization environment. The package provides various optimization formulations for machine learning models (such as full-space, reduced-space, and MILP) as well as an interface to import sequential Keras and general ONNX models.

Further details can be found in our `arXiv preprint <https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02414>`_, `presentation <http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~rmisener/OMLT_Slides.pdf>`_, and `YouTube playlist <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp-aH4lmttFkbw89wzpMQKqBWS_04PK3n>`_.
